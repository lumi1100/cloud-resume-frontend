# Front-End Resume

### Introduction
This is a personal web-based résumé project built with HTML, CSS (SCSS), and JavaScript.

### How to Run
Open the `index.html` file via a **local development server**.

⚠️ **Important:**  
Do **not** open the file directly in your browser (e.g., `file://index.html`).  
Modern browsers enforce **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions**, which may block requests when loading the file directly.  
Instead, start a local server and access the project through `http://localhost`.

### Run with Different Tools

#### Option 1: Python
```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8080
